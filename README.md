# Gold-Badge-Challenges-Final
This is my attempt at our final for Gold Badge. This project can be used by anyone who wishes to add-to or change some things around. Although it is intended to be updated as more
knowledge is attained. This is a testament to what I both know and don't how to do so far in C#. It's been a short while since its initial creation.
All current/up-to-date code can be found at: https://github.com/CACorpusV526/Gold-Badge-Challenges-Final-
